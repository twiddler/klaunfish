A simple chess bot just for fun! :robot:

Run

```console
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

to play!

You can also serve this at lichess.org! `setup.sh` clones [namin/lichess-bot](https://github.com/namin/lichess-bot) and sets up almost everything. You will have to configure `config.yml` in the automatically created temporary folder yourself. Keep a copy of your configuration somewhere else so that it won't be deleted when your temporary files are!
